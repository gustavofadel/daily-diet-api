# Daily Diet API

## Overview

The Daily Diet API was developed with the purpose of helping users maintain control over the meals they consume. It allows for the registration, viewing, modification, and deletion of meals, as well as user registration, login, and the visualization of metrics related to their meals. The API was developed using the TypeScript language with the Fastify microframework, the Knex query builder, the Zod library for validation, and the Vitest framework for end-to-end testing.

## Features

- **User Registration:** Create a new user.

- **User Identification:** Users are identified across requests.

- **Meal Recording (POST /meals):** Record meals with the following information:
  - Name
  - Description
  - Date and Time
  - Diet Status (within or outside the diet)

- **Meal Editing (PUT /meals/:id):** Modify meal details, including all the attributes mentioned above.

- **Meal Deletion (DELETE /meals/:id):** Delete meal entries.

- **List User Meals (GET /users/meals):** Retrieve a list of all meals associated with a user.

- **View Single Meal (GET /meals/:id):** Get details of a single meal entry.

- **User Metrics (GET /users/metrics):** Retrieve user-specific metrics, including:
  - Total number of registered meals
  - Total number of meals within the diet
  - Total number of meals outside the diet
  - Best sequence of meals within the diet

Users can only perform actions (view, edit, delete) on the meals they have created.
